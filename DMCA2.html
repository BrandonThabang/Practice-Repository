		What is DMCA?
		</h2>
		<p>
		The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a 1998 United States copyright law that implements two 1996 treaties of the World Intellectual
		Property Organization (WIPO). It criminalizes production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures 
		that control access to copyrighted works (commonly known as digital rights management or DRM). It also criminalizes the act of circumventing an 
		access control, whether or not there is actual infringement of copyright itself. In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright 
		infringement on the Internet.[1][2] Passed on October 12, 1998, by a unanimous vote in the United States Senate and signed into law by President 
		Bill Clinton on October 28, 1998, the DMCA amended Title 17 of the United States Code to extend the reach of copyright, while limiting the 
		liability of the providers of online services for copyright infringement by their users.
		</p>
		<p>
		The DMCA's principal innovation in the field of copyright is the exemption from direct and indirect liability of Internet service providers and
		other intermediaries. This exemption was adopted by the European Union in the Electronic Commerce Directive 2000. The Information Society Directive
		2001 implemented the 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty in the EU.
